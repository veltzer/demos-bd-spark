# Count number of bash users

Write a python script that counts the numbger of users that are using
`/bin/bash` as their shell.

Run my solution in Scala to count the number of users on your system using
`/bin/bash` as their shell.

Compare the two solutions.
Which is simpler? Which is more complicated? Which is more scalable?


Hints:
* Use `spark-shell -i [code.scala]` to run your script.
* Use `System.exit(0)` at the end of your script to shut down your local spark.
