# Spark Sales Analysis Exercise

## Overview
This exercise involves creating a comprehensive sales analysis system using Apache Spark. You'll work with e-commerce data to generate various analytical reports that provide insights into sales patterns, customer behavior, and product performance.

## Project Structure

```tree
spark-sales-analysis/
├── data/
│   ├── sales_transactions.csv
│   ├── products.csv
│   └── customers.csv
├── src/
│   ├── generate_data.py
│   └── sales_analysis.py
└── reports/
    ├── monthly_revenue_[timestamp].csv
    ├── top_products_[timestamp].csv
    ├── segment_analysis_[timestamp].csv
    ├── retention_rate_[timestamp].csv
    └── category_analysis_[timestamp].csv
```

## Data Description

### sales_transactions.csv
- transaction_id: Unique identifier for each sale
- date: Transaction date
- product_id: Product identifier
- quantity: Number of items sold
- unit_price: Price per unit
- customer_id: Customer identifier

### products.csv
- product_id: Unique identifier for each product
- product_name: Name of the product
- category: Product category
- supplier_id: Supplier identifier

### customers.csv
- customer_id: Unique identifier for each customer
- customer_segment: Customer segment (Premium, Standard, Basic)
- join_date: Date when customer joined
- country: Customer's country

## Requirements

### 1. Data Processing
- Load and clean data from CSV files
- Handle missing values appropriately
- Validate data integrity
- Implement proper error handling

### 2. Required Analysis
Implement the following analyses:

#### Sales Analysis
- Calculate monthly revenue trends
- Identify top 10 products by revenue
- Analyze revenue distribution by region
- Calculate year-over-year growth rates

#### Customer Insights
- Analyze performance by customer segment
- Track customer acquisition trends
- Calculate average order value by segment
- Determine customer retention rates

#### Product Performance
- Perform category-wise sales analysis
- Identify seasonal trends in product categories
- Calculate inventory turnover rates

### 3. Technical Requirements
- Use PySpark SQL for data processing
- Implement proper data cleaning and validation
- Create reusable functions
- Include logging
- Optimize performance
- Generate both CSV and Parquet output formats

## Implementation Steps

1. Set Up Environment
    - Install required packages:

```bash
pip install pyspark pandas numpy
```

1. Generate Sample Data
    - Run data generator:

```bash
python generate_data.py
```

1. Implement Analysis
    - Create sales analysis implementation
    - Run the analysis:

```bash
python sales_analysis.py
```

1. Verify Results
    - Check generated reports in the reports directory
    - Validate analysis results
    - Review performance metrics

## Expected Outputs

The solution should generate multiple report files:

1. Monthly Revenue Report
    - Monthly revenue trends

1. Top Products Report
    - Best-selling products
    - Revenue contribution
    - Category distribution

1. Customer Segment Analysis
    - Segment performance
    - Average order values
    - Customer counts

1. Retention Analysis
    - Monthly retention rates
    - Cohort analysis
    - Customer lifecycle patterns

1. Category Performance
    - Category-wise sales
    - Seasonal patterns
    - Product mix analysis
