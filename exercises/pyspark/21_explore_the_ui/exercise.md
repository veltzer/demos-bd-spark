# Explore the Spark UI

Pick a job from any previous exercises.

Add a pausing line to the job:

```python
input("Pausing job so you could look at it in the spark ui...")
```

Run it with the standlone cluster.
Reminder: you need to point your job as .master("spark://localhost:7077")

Wait for the job to reach the pausing line.

Explore the spark ui for that specific job.
