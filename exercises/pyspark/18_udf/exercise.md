# UDF exercise

* get some data with ips in it.
    (I'll post some example data in the exercise folder).

* write a user defined function to extract the third number from an ip address.

```text
10.0.80.34 -> 8
```

* use your function in two ways:
    * in a spark data frame execution.
    * in a spark sql statement.
